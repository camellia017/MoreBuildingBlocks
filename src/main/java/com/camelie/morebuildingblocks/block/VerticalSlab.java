/**
 * Static helpers describing an upright ("vertical") slab state. Injected into
 * {@link net.minecraft.world.level.block.SlabBlock} by
 * {@code com.camelie.morebuildingblocks.mixin.SlabBlockMixin} so that every vanilla slab block can also
 * be placed upright without registering a new block.
 *
 * <p>This class deliberately does NOT live in the {@code ...mixin} package: Mixin claims that entire
 * package and refuses to let ordinary code reference anything inside it
 * ({@code IllegalClassLoadError: ... is in a defined mixin package ... and cannot be referenced
 * directly}).
 *
 * <p>The two extra block state properties live in {@link MBBlockStateProperties}. Vanilla's
 * {@code type} keeps its meaning - "which half is filled": on a flat slab it selects the bottom or
 * top half of the Y axis, and on an upright slab the negative or positive half of {@code axis}.
 *
 * <p>Every placed slab, flat or upright, fills exactly one half of exactly one axis. {@link Fill}
 * is that single sentence written down, and it is also what the placement rule decides: the rule
 * picks which half of the block the player is pointing at, in whichever axis that half lies.
